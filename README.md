# Final Project PSD A4 - Bicubic Interpolation Image Upscaling Hardware Accelerator on VHDL

## Background

Hardware Accelerator Image Upscaling is a hardware which can improve image quality by increasing the number of pixels (padding) in the image. Hardware Accelerator Image Upscaling is made to speed up the upscaling process without the need for a PC or laptop. This Hardware Accelerator is generally used in the process of improving the quality of CCTV or cameras with low resolution quality in order to get a higher quality.

Our project aims to recreate the functionality of the Hardware Accelerator Image Upscaling hardware using VHDL, a hardware description language used to design and simulate digital systems.
