# Final Project PSD A4 - Bicubic Interpolation Image Upscaling Hardware Accelerator on VHDL

## Background

Photography is an activity that is quite popular among young people these days. The camera is one of the tools used to do photography in order to get maximum portrait results. However, sometimes when we are taking a photo using a camera or a cellphone that has a low resolution, the portrait results are often unsatisfactory, because the images are not sharp and tend to be blurry. To increase the resolution of an image, a special algorithm is needed, namely bicubic interpolation. However, running this algorithm can greatly burden the performance of the PC or laptop used.

In overcoming the problem of using the bicubic interpolation algorithm which can burden the user's PC or laptop. Our group designed a bicubic interpolation algorithm that can be run in an Image Upscaling Hardware Accelerator. We designed this hardware accelerator using an FPGA base which we can describe using the VHDL programming language.
